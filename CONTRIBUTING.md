# How to Contribute

1. Create a feature branch off the `main` branch (this will require [forking the project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)).
2. Make your changes (either using the GitHub web console or locally).
3. If local development, push your branch up to GitHub.
4. Create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to the original repository.
5. Submit an [issue](../../issues) with the details of the changes.
6. The change will be reviewed and considered for merging back into the project.

**NOTE:** Though contributions are welcome, there is no guarantee that your change will be approved and merged.  That will depend on a number of factors, such as the quality of the submission and the functionality or changes that are being proposed.
